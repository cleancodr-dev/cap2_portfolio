# CLEANCODR – Capstone 2 Project

This is my second Capstone project, built as part of my web development journey.
It visually mimics the structure of an HTML document — written entirely in **HTML and CSS**, with no JavaScript.

The site is styled to resemble a sketchbook or a blueprint, showing both the **semantic HTML structure** and the **actual content** side-by-side — a concept I call _draft-ception_.

---

## 🎯 Project Idea

The goal of this capstone was to:

- Recreate a clean, readable HTML structure as a real-world website
- Build a responsive layout without any JavaScript
- Lay the foundation for my own open-source **template library**

This page is not just a project — it’s also a prototype for a larger idea:

> A **Sketchbook-style Template Library** to help other developers build visually structured and creative websites using just HTML & CSS.
